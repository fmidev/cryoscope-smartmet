WHAT HAS C3S CLIMATE DATA ENABLED YOU TO DO ( in relation to your work with the forest industry on harvester seasons)

and suggest the following structure for your answer.

•	THE PROBLEM – e.g. INCREASED PREVALENCE IN/RISK OF 
Forestry conditions are changing, winter get shorter, snow depths vary frozen soil is less abundant. A few difficult years have alerted the forestry industry in Finland to get better informed

•	THE CLIMATE DATA NEED 
Basically the interest for local climate information and more precisely weather forecasts has increased significantly. In the process the potential for long seasonal forecast has been raised and the use cases for these become also clear.

•	THE SOLUTION  e.g. WHAT YOU DEVELOPED 
Combining static high resolution trafficability maps with bias adjusting C3S seasonal forecasts based on ERA5-Land reanalysis and informing users both on very local climate conditions and a bit of precitability further into the future.

•	THE BENEFITS 
Harvester Seasons has revealed new opportunities to organize cutting for a much longer time horizon ahead. It leads overall to improved efficiency This is especially interesting for wood procurement by the former pulp now bioeconomy factories.
